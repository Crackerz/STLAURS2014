            <p>The Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium (CAURS) is one of the largest annual undergraduate research conferences in the country, bringing together hundreds of undergraduate students in the Chicagoland area from all academic disciplines to present their research and explore work that is being done by other students. Through poster sessions, oral presentations, and roundtable discussions, attendees experience the impressive breadth and depth of research being conducted by their peers and network with other undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and representatives from industry and graduate and professional schools.</p>
            <p>CAURS 2012 is scheduled for Saturday, March 3, 2012 at the <a href="http://www.martplaza.com/">Holiday Inn Mart Plaza Chicago Hotel</a>, and preparations for the symposium are currently underway. Please check back soon for more updates on this yearâ€™s conference!</p>
            <h4>Poster Presentations</h4>
            <img class="right" src="http://www.caurs.com/New%20Website/images/presenter1.jpg" />
            <p>All symposium participants present their research with a poster. Posters should be approximately four feet wide and three feet tall. Posters can be printed or assembled.</p>
            <p>Presenters must be available to discuss their displays during their assigned poster session. A few specifics on the poster boards: posters must be readable from at least three feet away, the presentation title must be at least two inches high, and beneath the title, the name(s) of the student author(s), faculty advisor, and home institution must be at least one inch high. CAURS reserves the right to cancel a presenter's poster session if the above requirements are not met.</p>
            <h4>Oral Presentations</h4>
            <img class="right" src="http://www.caurs.com/New%20Website/images/oralpresenter.jpg" />
            <p>Some participants who indicate their interest during registration will also be chosen to present an oral presentation. Oral presentations should be 10 minutes in length with three additional minutes for a question-and-answer period. Powerpoint or Keynote may be used. Speakers who are confirmed for their presentation should make arrangements with the CAURS staff to make sure their presentation formats will work.  Speakers are highly encouraged to arrive early to the event to confirm that audiovisual materials are compatible and working for your specific presentation.</p><p>Due to space limitations, only a limited number of oral presentations will be accepted by the Inter-School Board for the event. Presentations will be chosen based on the quality of the abstract and research, and on variety from the perspective of the entire event and highlighting work from each participating institution.</p>
			<h4>Artwork Submissions</h4>

            <p>We highly encourage students who are submitting their research to also submit examples of photographs and other media that were important in their investigation, but may also serve an aesthetic purpose. Anyone interested in submitting their artwork should email info@caurs.com. We will make the arrangements for the display.</p></div>
