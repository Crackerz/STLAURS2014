            <h1>Oral Presentation Guidelines</h1>
			<div id="guidelines">
<p>Oral presentations are extended speeches about your research using materials such as Powerpoint, multimedia, and a podium. They should last no more than 10 minutes with 3-5 additional minutes for a question-and-answer period. An oral presentation is similar to a short paper with an introduction, main body, and conclusion.<br />A moderator keeps track of your presentation time and may also facilitate the discussion.</p>
<h4>PREPARATION</h4><p>Preparation is the key to giving an effective presentation and to reducing your nervousness. You are the expert on the topic in the room, so know your topic well. You will find that you know much more about your topic than you will have time to present, which is a good thing. It will allow you to create a good introduction, to distill out the most important points that need to be made, and to finish with a strong conclusion.
<ul class="guidelinelist"><li>Know your topic - become an expert, which will also boost your self confidence</li><li>Be cognizant of the background and educational level of your audience so you know how much detail to go into and what kinds of concepts you may have to define</li><li>Prepare an outline. Start and finish with a bang.</li><li>Never read a presentation. Use an outline if you wish, but do not read directly from it.</li></ul>
<h4>VISUAL AIDS</h4>
<p>Visual aids (maps, photos, film clips, graphs, diagrams, and charts) can enhance a presentation.
<ul class="guidelinelist"><li>Keep visual aids simple and uncluttered.</li><li>Use color and contrast for emphasis but use them in moderation</li><li>Use a font size large enough to be seen from the back of the room (A rule of thumb: slides are readable from the back of a room if they are readable at a distance of 9 feet from a 15" monitor)</li><li>Resist the temptation to use too many slides and become dependent on them</li><li>If using PowerPoint, do not use sound effects and dramatic slide transitions</li></ul></p>
<h4>PRACTICE</h4>
<p>Practice giving your presentation to yourself.  Speak aloud and time yourself. Practice using your visual aids. It is important that you adhere to your time limit. Your professor knows that you know more about your topic than you will have time to share. Your goal is to inform, not overwhelm. In this case, less can be more.</p>
<h4>DELIVERY</h4>
<p>To deliver a good and effective presentation, you will have to overcome your nervousness and be prepared for the room conditions.  Good preparation should dispel most of your nervousness.  Your presentation will never go exactly as you expect – but in fact, they usually turn out better. If you are using any kind of technology such as an overhead projector or PowerPoint, however, be prepared with a backup plan in case anything goes wrong.</p>
<h4>EQUIPMENT TIPS</h4>
<p><ul class="guidelinelist"><li>Work out details with equipment before the day of your presentation; request any equipment well before the event and make sure any necessary software (such as PowerPoint) is installed</li><li>Know how to operate the equipment you choose to use</li><li>Have backup copies of everything!</li><li>Consider making printouts of your slides or transparencies in case there is a problem with electricity or bulbs</li><li>Do not expect an internet connection to work when you need it. Have any web sites you want to show available as offline copies.</li></ul></p>
<h4>DELIVERY TIPS</h4>
<p><ul class="guidelinelist"><li>Begin your presentation by telling your audience what your topic is and what you will be covering.  A brief outline of your presentation will help guide and orient the audience.</li><li>Avoid reading your remarks directly from your preparation materials.</li><li>Dress neatly and appropriately. The rule of thumb is to dress one level nicer than the audience will be dressed.</li><li>Do not wear a hat of any kind</li><li>Speak loudly and clearly – loud enough to be clearly heard in the back row.</li><li>Stand up straight.  Don’t be afraid to move around the room –it causes the audience to pay attention</li><li>Do not do anything that will distract from your content – try to overcome any nervous fidgeting or habits such as pencil twirling or rocking back and forth.</li><li>Do not apologize to your audience for the state of your knowledge or your degree of preparation. The audience wants to have confidence in you – do not do anything that undermines your authority.</li><li>Never mention anything that could have been in your talk but wasn’t.</li><li>Make frequent eye contact with the audience.</li><li>If you are using slides or PowerPoint, avoid speaking to the screen instead of to the audience.  Be familiar enough with your materials that the only reason you look at them is to point something out.</li><li>Never turn your back on the audience and try to avoid walking in front of the projector</li><li>Adhere strictly to your time limit.</li><li>At the conclusion of your presentation, ask for questions. Encourage questions with your eyes and your body language. Respond to questions politely, good-humoredly, and briefly. Take a brief moment to compose your thoughts before responding but do not say “uh….”</li><li>At the end of your presentation, summarize your main points and give a strong concluding remark that reinforces why your information is of value.  Show enthusiasm</li></ul></p>
