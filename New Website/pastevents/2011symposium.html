<h4>April 2, 2011</h4>
<p>The 2011 Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium was held on April 02, 2011 at the Museum of Science and Industry. Over 250 undergraduates from several institutions presented over 230 research projects as poster presentations and 16 oral presentations in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, social sciences, psychology, humanities, and engineering.  Many faculty members, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows from both participating and affiliate institutions generously donated their time to judge these poster and oral presentations.</p>
<p>John Boyer, Dean of The College of the Unversity of Chicago, gave the opening address to begin the conference. Immediately after the opening address, students had an opportunity to view each other&rsquo;s posters during the poster viewing session. Presentation Session I, immediatey following the Poster Viewing Session, featured one half of the poster presentations and two sessions or oral presentations, Biological Science and Social Science/Humanities. The oral presentations featured four students from each discipline. Each oral presentations lasted 15 minutes each and ran simutaneously with the poster session. Once Presentation Session I concluded, presenters and judges enjoyed a snack break with Roundtable Discussions. Many participants also used this time to explore the museum.</p>
<p>Following the Roundtable Discussions, the second Presentaiton Session featuring the remaining posters as well as Physics/ Engineering and Chemistry oral presentations began. After the two hour session and the Museum had closed to the public, students and judges were escorted to the Museum&rsquo;s Rotunda where they enjoyed dinner, a compelling keynote address by Dr. John Cacioppo, and award ceremony.</p>
