            	<h4>April 10, 2010</h4>
                <p>The 2010 Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium was held on April 10, 2010 at the Andrew J. McGowan Chemistry and Environmental Science Building (1110 W. Belden Avenue, Chicago, IL 60614) on <a href="http://www.depaul.edu/">DePaul University's</a> Lincoln Park campus. Over 200 undergraduates from several institutions presented 140 research projects as poster presentations and 24 oral presentations in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, social sciences, psychology, humanities, and engineering. These projects spanned a wide range of subfields, from tissue engineering to organic synthesis to social psychology . Many faculty members from the participating institutions generously donated their time to judge these poster and oral presentations.</p><p>Lynn Narasimhan, Ph.D, Associate Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Science, gave the opening address to begin the conference. Immediately after the opening address, students presented their research posters during Poster Session I. Following poster session I, students, judges, and guests headed to the ballroom in DePaul's Student Center to enjoy lunch with roundtable discussions. The roundtable discussions allowed the students to learn about unique post-graduate opportunities such as graduate fellowships and unconventional career paths such as patent law. Following lunch with roundtables, 24 students presented oral presentations simultaneously in six classrooms in the Andrew J. McGowan Science Pavilion. Immediately following oral presentations, students presented more of their research posters during Poster Session II.</p><p>Poster Session II was followed by a thirty minute served reception in the ballroom's pre-event area, where students, judges, and guests were served appetizers and beverages as they waited for the banquet dinner to be served. After the banquet dinner, Dr. Rocky Kolb, Professor and Chair of The University of Chicago's Astronomy and Astrophysics department, delivered a fascinating keynote speech. The evening concluded with the presentation of <a href="http://www.caurs.com/New20%Website/awards.html">awards</a> to the event's outstanding poster and oral presenters.</p>
<h4>Speakers</h4><p>This year's opening address was given by <span class="strong">Dr. Lynn Narasimhan</span>, the current Associate Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Science at DePaul University and a professor of Mathematical Sciences. Dr. Narasimhan received her Ph.D. in Mathematics from Northwestern University in 1977 and joined the faculty at DePaul twoyears later. She has taught numerous undergraduate courses for both majors and non-majors, and received the university's Excellence in Teaching Award in 1992. For the past 10 years, she has been active in mathematics and science education and is currently Director of DePaul's Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Center which oversees programs that support minority students and women in mathematics and science, such as Alliance for Minority Participation program and the Clare Boothe Luce Scholarship program, and programs for teachers funded by the Illinois Board of Higher Education and the National Science Foundation.</p><img class="speaker" src="http://www.caurs.com/New%20Website/images/headshots/DrKolb.jpg" /><p>This year's keynote address was given by <span class="strong"><a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/~rocky/">Dr. Rocky Kolb</a></span>, a Arthur Holly Compton Distinguished Service Professor of Astronomy & Astrophysics and the College and Chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago, as well as a member of the Enrico Fermi Institute, and the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics. In 1983 he was the founding head of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group and in 2004 the founding Director of the Particle Astrophysics Center at Fermilab.The Field of Rocky's research is the application of elementary-particle physics to the very early Universe. In addition to over 200 scientific papers, he is the co-author of The Early Universe, the standard textbook on particle physics and cosmology, and the author of a book for the general public, Blind Watchers in the Sky.</p><p>His scientific research was recently recognized by the 2010 Dannie Heineman Prize of the American Institute of Physics and the American Astronomical Society (shared with Michael Turner). He received the Oersted Medal of the American Association of Physics Teachers for outstanding, widespread, and lasting impact on the teaching of physics. His classroom teaching at the University of Chicago was recognized by the 1993 Quantrell Prize for teaching excellence and the 2009 teaching award of the Graham School of General Studies. He received the 1996 Emme Award of the American Aeronautical Society for science writing. Rocky is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a Fellow of the American Physical Society.</p>
