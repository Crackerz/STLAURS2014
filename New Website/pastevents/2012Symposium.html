<h4>March 3rd, 2012</h4>
<p>The 2012 Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium was held on March 3rd, 2012 at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza Chicago Hotel. Over 200 undergraduates from several institutions in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, social sciences, psychology, humanities, and engineering. Many faculty members, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows from both participating and affiliate institutions generously donated their time to judge these poster and oral presentations. Industry, professional society, and graduate school representatives gave undergraduates the opportunity to ask questions and explore future career paths.</p>
<p>John Boyer, Dean of The College of the Unversity of Chicago, gave the opening address to begin the conference. Immediately after the opening address, students had an opportunity to view each other&rsquo;s posters during the poster viewing session. Presentation Session I, immediatey following the Poster Viewing Session, featured one half of the poster presentations and two sessions or oral presentations, Biological Science and Social Science/Humanities. The oral presentations featured four students from each discipline. Each oral presentations lasted 15 minutes each and ran simutaneously with the poster session. Once Presentation Session I concluded, presenters and judges enjoyed a snack break with Roundtable Discussions. Many participants also used this time to explore the museum.</p>
<p>Following the Roundtable Discussions, the second Presentaiton Session featuring the remaining posters as well as Physics/ Engineering and Chemistry oral presentations began. After the two hour session and the Museum had closed to the public, students and judges were escorted to the Museum&rsquo;s Rotunda where they enjoyed dinner, a compelling keynote address by Dr. John Cacioppo, and award ceremony.</p>
<h4>Speakers</h4>
<p>This year's opening speaker was Samuel Attoh, Ph.D., the Dean of the Graduate School and Associate Provost for Research and Centers at Loyola University Chicago. Dr. Attoh is devoted to facilitating the University’s commitment to academic excellence, research enhancement, service, and the stimulation of progressive change and innovation at the graduate level in all of Loyola’s schools and colleges. Dr. Attoh strongly supports the development of new programs, encouraging interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary initiatives that are intellectually stimulating and mission-focused, and fostering strategic partnerships and alliances within and beyond the University. His research and teaching interests lie in urban and regional planning, housing, and community development, and the geography of international development.</p>
<p>This year's keynote address was given by Robert G. Morrison, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Loyola University Chicago and the Stritch School of Medicine. Dr. Morrison uses behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging methods to investigate memory and reasoning throughout the lifespan. Dr. Morrison received his B.S. in Chemistry from Wheaton College prior to studying visual art at the Cleveland Institute of Art. While working as an artist Morrison became fascinated with the cognitive science of creativity. He pursued this interest studying visual mental imaging at Cleveland State University prior to receiving his Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2004. After co-founding Xunesis and completing a National Institute of Aging-funded post- doctoral fellowship at Northwestern University, Morrison joined the Department of Psychology and the Neuroscience Institute at Loyola in 2009.</p>
