            	<h4>April 23, 2005</h4>
                <p>The first annual Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium (CAURS) involving the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Loyola University Chicago and Northwestern University took place on April 23, 2005. This stimulating day-long event provided an excellent opportunity for undergraduate students, faculty, alumni, and the Chicago research community to actively participate in the support of undergraduate research.</p><p>More than 80 students presented their research findings through oral and poster presentations to faculty, staff, members of the Chicago research community, and their families and friends. In addition to the poster and oral presentations, students and attendees participated in an academic and career forum and listened to a lecture on stem-cell research by Harinder Singh, Ph.D., Professor of Molecular Genetics & Cell Biology at the University of Chicago.</p><p>Students who present their research, and their advisors, were invited to attend the awards banquet where they enjoyed dinner and listened to an inspiring Keynote Address by Dr. Steven Rosen, MD, FACP, a Genevieve Teuton Professor of Medicine, at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.</p><p>The day perfectly reflected the four participating universities' commitment to faculty-mentored undergraduate research.</p>
                <h4>Comments</h4>
				<p>"I want to congratulate all the students involved with the Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium. It was a great event and definitely one of the best research symposiums I've seen in 5 years at NU." -Thy Nguyen, Assistant Director Undergraduate Career Services Northwestern University</p><p>"Thank you for organizing such an impressive research symposium. The quality of research presented was outstanding, and every student should be proud of their accomplishments." -UC Faculty Member </p><p>"I was impressed with the scope of the research presented by undergraduates from the Chicago area and beyond. I really got the feeling that most of these students performed the bulk of the research themselves, with minimal input from advisors, graduate students, and post-docs. Finally, what struck me most profoundly was the fact that it was the undergraduates themselves--with no prior expertise, and while simultaneously fulfilling their duties as full-time students--who orchestrated the entire event. Great job!" -Shelby Hatch, Ph.D. Northwestern University </p><p>"This was a great research symposium; I couldn't imagine it being any better." -Hilary Godwin, Ph.D. Associate Professor & Chair Department of Chemistry Northwestern University </p>
