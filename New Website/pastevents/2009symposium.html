            	<h4>April 18, 2009</h4>
                <p>The 2009 Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium was held on April 18, 2009 at the <a href="http://www.cancer.northwestern.edu/">Robert H. Lurie Cancer Center</a> (303 N. Superior, Chicago, IL 60611) on the campus of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine on April 18, 2009. Over 150 undergraduates from several institutions presented 134 research projects as poster presentations and 20 oral presentations in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, social sciences, psychology, humanities, engineering, mathematics, and economics. These projects spanned a wide range of subfields, from nanoscale engineering to music cognition to Filipino Architecture. Many faculty members from the participating institutions generously donated their time to judge these poster and oral presentations.</p>
<p>Jay Walsh, Ph.D, Vice-President for Research at Northwestern University, gave the opening address to begin the conference. Oral presentations were held simulataneously in 5 different rooms, following lunch. After oral presentations in the afternoon, students were given the oppportunity to engage in roundtable discussions during the coffee break. These discussions allowed the students to learn about unique post-graduate opportunities such as graduate fellowships, M.D./Ph.D. programs, and careers in non-profit organizations. After a banquet dinner, the fascinating keynote speech was given by Dr. Shannon Hackett, curator and Head of the Division of Birds at the Field Museum of Chicago. Many faculty members from the participating institutions generously donated their time to judge these poster and oral presentations.</p>
<h4>Speakers</h4>
<img class="speaker" src="http://www.caurs.com/New%20Website/images/headshots/jaywalsh.jpg" /><p>Our opening address was given by Dr. Joseph Walsh, Ph.D. Dr. Joseph (Jay) Walsh is currently Northwestern University's Vice-President for Research and a professor of biomedical engineering. Vice-President Walsh received a bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Immediately following receipt of his PhD in medical engineering from Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he joined the Northwestern faculty in 1988 and began research that would form the foundation for laser-based procedures in medicine and surgery. Among his many awards are being recognized as McCormick's Teacher of the Year and Advisor of the Year. Vice-President Walsh has been a strong supporter not only of McCormick School of Engineering and Northwestern University, but also of collaboration and the importance of undergraduate research.</p><img class="speaker" src="http://www.caurs.com/New%20Website/images/headshots/shannonhackett.png" />
<p>Our featured keynote speaker was Dr. Shannon Hackett. Dr. Hackett is the associate curator at the Field Museum of Natural History and Head of the Division of Birds, Zoology Department. Her research program focuses on the evolution of tropical birds in Africa, Madagascar, and the Neotropics. She uses genetics, morphology, and behavior to reconstruct how populations and species evolved. Along with her research, Dr. Hackett is involved with efforts to promote conservation and women in science.</p>
