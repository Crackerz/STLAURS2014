			<div id="registrationcontent">
            	<p>The American Undergraduate Research Society invites you to join us for our Eight Annual Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium (CAURS) on March 3, 2012 at the Holiday Inn Plaza Mart. This will be the eighth year that CAURS is giving an opportunity for undergraduates from leading Chicago area universities to present their research to distinguished faculty in a professional setting. DePaul University, Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, Loyola University, the Illinois Institute of Technology, and University of Illinois at Chicago are all participating in the symposium.</p>
<p>Since CAURS is equally dependent on faculty support and student participation, we would kindly like you to consider being a judge for the event. All areas of expertise in the social and physical sciences are welcome. A judge's responsibility is to rate the quality of the participant's presentation and research.</p>
<p>There will be two types of presentations, poster sessions and an oral presentation. You may choose to judge for one or both sessions. Tentatively, the presentations sessions are from 12:45 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. The oral presentations and poster presentations will run simultaneously. Please register to become a judge by clicking below to fill out the registration form. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering participating in the 8th Annual Chicago Area Undergraduate Symposium. We look forward to hearing from you! Thank you in advance for the generous donation of your time in support of undergraduate research!</p>
<p>[Judging registration will open soon]
