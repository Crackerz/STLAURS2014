The Kinetics of Native Chemical Ligation with Proline Thioesters

Native chemical ligation is a chemistry in which the side chain thiol of the N-terminal Cys in a cysteine-peptide attacks the thioester moiety of a peptide-thioester, and then rearranges to form a product in which the two peptides are covalently linked by a native peptide bond. The rate of this reaction is highly dependent on the identity of the C-terminal amino acid on the thioester segment , and the current understanding is that more sterically hindered amino acids adjacent to the thioester will block the attack site and cause the reaction to proceed more slowly. Proline—which apparently lacks significant steric hindrance—reacts the slowest of all natural amino acids as a peptide-Pro-thioester and so constitutes a direct challenge to this hypothesis. To address this inconsistency, model peptides were created using solid phase peptide synthesis and their ligation rates were monitored using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). Steric hindrance was eliminated as a possible explanation for proline’s slow ligation rate, and hydrogen bonding, lone pair donation, and “folding over” were investigated as alternative hypotheses. Currently pseudo-proline amino acids—amino acids with an internal 5-membered ring structure that may be selectively transformed into fast ligating serine or cysteine—are being investigated with the aim of controlling reactivity in native chemical ligation and thus developing a novel tool to be added to the arsenal of synthetic protein techniques.
