New Constraints on Hydroclimatic Change During the Last 10,000 Years in Fallen Leaf Lake, Lake Tahoe Basin, California

	The Sierra Nevada is the primary source of California’s urban and agricultural water resources. To understand the potential for severe and prolonged drought in the Sierra’s it is necessary to study past events recorded by proxy data. Fallen Leaf Lake (FLL), California, is a unique glaciolacustrine environment in which several climate proxies exist with the potential to provide records of hydroclimatic change during the last ~10,000 years. Recent studies have discovered submerged and upright trees rooted ~36 m below the surface of FLL, and have presented evidence for lake-size fluctuations and a mid-Holocene dry period in the eastern Sierras.
	Our group conducted field campaigns during 2006 - 2008 to collect high-resolution marine geophysical data and sediment cores to search for additional submerged trees, as well as geomorphic and sedimentary evidence for hydroclimatic changes. A sidescan sonar survey of FLL provided complete coverage of the lakefloor and successfully imaged as many as 9 upright trees and over 80 downed trees, in addition to multiple submerged paleoshorelines along the entire circumference of FLL to depths >~60 m.  Several features were ground-truthed with ROV video footage. Seismic CHIRP data and 5 piston cores had been previously collected, and defined the depositional history and stratigraphic framework of FLL.  
	Overall, the data suggest dramatic fluctuations in the shoreline and depositional patterns have occurred during the Holocene and demonstrate (1) the feasibility of high-resolution geophysical methods towards finding paleoclimate proxies and (2) the potential for future work in FLL to study Holocene hydroclimatic variability.
