A Comparative Genomic approch for studying the molecular Evolution of Group A Streptococcus pyogenes strains


Numerous studies have been conducted examining the compositional frequencies, e.g. di-, tri-, tetra-nucleotide frequencies, codon usage patterns, etc., between the genomes of closely related organisms as well as within a single genome’s structure. These examinations reveal regions of high similarity as well as regions of dissimilarity such as those introduced through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Previously, we developed an application called S-plot for performing alignment-free genome comparisons based upon the distribution of the frequency of short subsequences within a sliding window. Herein we present the second generation of this application in which additional functionality has been introduced, most notably the ability to perform such comparisons using fixed as well as variable sized windows allowing for the analysis of individual coding regions. A thorough examination of 13 publicly available complete Group A Streptococcus pyogenes strains were examined. Streptococcus pyogenes, while a normal member of the human nasopharyngeal flora, can also lead to a wide variety of much more severe diseases including necrotizing fasciitis. Using our application we found significant chromosomal rearrangement as well as regions of unusual statistical composition suggesting they were acquired through HGT. More interestingly though, we were able to observe variable rates of evolution across each genome.
