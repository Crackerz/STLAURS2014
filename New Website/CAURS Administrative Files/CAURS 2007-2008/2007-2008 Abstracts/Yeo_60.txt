Systematic metallurgical procedure is developing currently 
for non-destructive evaluation method of 52,100 steel products. 
The metallurgical procedure includes measurement of hardness, cutting, 
mounting, polishing, and etching process. The most acceptable 
machining processes and inspection techniques are developed by the 
method of trial and error. A Wilson TTT ARB hardness tester and 
ISOMET 2000 precision saw machine are proved to be the most suitable 
machines for measurement of hardness and cutting process. In etching 
process, various etchants including ethanol-based 4% Picric acid, 
ethanol-based 2% nital acid, the combination of ethanol-based 4% 
Picric and 2% Nital acid, and 100ml ethanol-based 4% picric acid with 
20ml soap solutions are tried to find the best etchant. The trials 
reveal that ethanol-based 4% picric acid is good for measuring the 
size of carbide and none of the etchants is good for measuring the 
size of grains. After developing the metallurgical procedure, 
measurement of eddy current and analysis of the data including 
current value and characteristics of microstructures of 52,100 steel 
specimens formed in different conditions will be performed.
