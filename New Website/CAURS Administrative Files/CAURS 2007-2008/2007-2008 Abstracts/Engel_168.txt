Visualizing the wireless atmosphere in ChicagoJeff EngelThe proliferation of wireless technology greatly impacts the modern city; what was once the realm of government operations and major corporations is now ubiquitous and available to anyone with a Wi-Fi router. The exponential increase in wireless adoption has placed a performance-heavy burden on wireless devices due to the shared nature of the wireless spectrum. Any two devices in close enough proximity with each other have the potential to interfere with one another. This problem increases with the concentration of devices in a particular area. However, there are currently no models that reliably explain the interactions between many wireless devices in a dense area. This makes it difficult to systematically identify the current state of the wireless spectrum in such an area. To solve that problem, I determine where nearby transmitters are located by analyzing data collected from mobile spectrum observatories positioned in strategic locations in the Chicago area. This is then compared to the FCC database of registered transmitters to determine correlations between the expected signal strengths and measured signals. The aggregated results are used to create a “heat map” of the wireless spectrum in the area, which can then be used to gain an understanding of dense urban signal propagation. My research provides the fundamental basis for emerging wireless technologies such as TV Whitespace and Cognitive Radio. Such information is also useful to regulators and lease holders to pinpoint unintentional or unauthorized transmitters. Ultimately, this management will enable further innovation and tap the full potential of wireless to serve society as a whole as we become ever unplugged and ever mobile.
