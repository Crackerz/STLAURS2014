Abstract

In recent years, metal nanoparticles, especially those composed of noble metals, have become increasingly promising as new sources of technologies. Exciting new areas for development range from negative index of refraction superlattices for sub-diffraction limit imaging to enhanced imaging techniques for localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectroscopy. On a technological level, it is beneficial to probe the possible ways to change the global structure of a nanoparticle superlattice in order to understand how to design novel structures. On a basic science level, many aspects of supported membrane mechanics and dynamics are not yet fully understood. Until recently, problems such as the energetic source of folds on membranes were not quite fully understood. Many other aspects of monolayer or thin membrane dynamics remain elusive, particularly because most membranes are difficult to image locally. Here, I will present research regarding the compression of a membrane of gold nanoparticles supported by some fluid substrate. By using a material that scatters strongly in the optical, I can easily image membrane dynamics on a local level. Analyzing membrane dynamics of a gold mono- or multilayer provides valuable information for both general membrane dynamics and innovative ways to structure nanocrystal superlattices.
