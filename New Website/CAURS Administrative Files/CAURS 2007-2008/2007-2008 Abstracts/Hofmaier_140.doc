s refugees are women and children.  Many of these refugees come to the United States seeking asylum. However,  under current United 
States asylum law, one may only apply for asylum due to persecution based on one of five enumerated categories: race/ethnicity, nationality, political membership, religious affiliation, and membership in a particular social group. For many women experienc
i
ng persecution at the hands of private actors for reasons outside the realms of the five enumerated categories, they are faced with a conundrum. Gender does not currently qualify as basis for which persecution can take place, thus, they must mold their ge
nder-based claims into one of the five categories. For the purpose of this study, }{\i gender-based persecution}{
 is defined as acts of violence committed specifically towards women in the form of rape, female genital mutilation, domestic violence and similar abus
e. However, my study suggests that many gender-based claims and circumstances under which they take place may hold a woman at a disadvantage when claiming membership in a category that does not adequately identify her persecution. Through analysis of 50 U
n
ited States asylum cases, I coded for which enumerated category a woman applies under as well as the type of gender-based claim she testifies to have encountered during her persecution. My findings shed light on which frames produce a more successful outc
ome for the asylum applicant and suggest great correlation and importance in establishing evidence and credibility with successful gender-based persecution claims.
