Reaction rates of atmospheric constituent in Chicago Air
Katarzyna Majewska
	The undergraduate research project at Loyola University of Chicago titled Reaction rates of atmospheric constituent in Chicago Air is based on analyzing the chemical constituents and the calculation of the reaction rates occurring in the Chicago air.  During the summer months of the previous two years, air samples from a 42C and a 49C Thermo Analyzer were continuously collected.  During the two academic school years, all the summer data has been graphed, carefully analyzed for errors and the reaction pathways have been gathered.  The graphs have further been compared and the possible pollution occurrence was on the outlook.  An Ion Chromatographer was used to see the exact compound compositions and their amount and analyzed to see any correlations with the data taken ten years ago and earlier.  Interesting correlations of different variants such as the temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and the wind direction have been graphed and compared for concentrations of the nitrogen oxides and ozone.  The calculations of the rates of the atmospheric reactions are being solved by looking at various articles mainly from the years from 1970 to 1980 where similar but far away from this actual research have occurred.
