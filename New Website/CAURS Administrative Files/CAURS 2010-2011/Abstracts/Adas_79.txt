Abstract

We are studying the mechanism for the movement of ethylene isocyanide (EtN) into and out of the distal heme pocket of sperm whale myoglobin (Mb).  Obtaining this mechanism will help us understand the importance of the orientations of residues surrounding the distal heme pocket (His-E7, Val-E11, and Arg-CD3), and how these residues contribute to the overall function of myglobin.  By mutating specific residues surrounding the distal heme pocket, we will form predictions about which residues are responsible for the movement of the EtN out of the distal heme pocket and then propose point mutations that can be used to study the EtN in sperm whale Mb.  
	The geometry of the bonds formed by ethyl-isocyanide to the Mb are similar to those of oxygen or carbon monoxide.  Certain changes in the structure of the protein may be seen in the structure of the EtN complexed with Mb relative to that of MbO2; specifically, the His-E7 appears to swing out of the heme pocket toward the solvent phase.  This movement is believed to be the source of the EtN’s escape from the heme pocket.  Understanding this mechanism will also shed light on the binding and escaping mechanisms of other large molecules that can bind to the heme pocket of Mb.
This proposal will examine the pathway of the EtN’s escape from the heme pocket by simulating its movement with mutated His-E7 residue on the distal end of the heme pocket.  The movement will be simulated using the approach of Target Molecular Dynamics (TMD), which will use steering forces to guide the EtN toward a target structure.  We will use TMD, as implemented in the molecular dynamics program NAMD, to calculate the specific mechanism by which the EtN is able to escape the distal side of the heme pocket in sperm whale Mb.
