Title:
Measurement of the Inhibition Potential of Melatonin on 
Beta-Amyloid Peptide Aggregation and its Mutations Using Congo Red

Abstract:
Victims of the neurodegenerative Alzheimer’s disease show the formation of amyloid 
plaques in the brain’s extracellular region caused by the folding of beta-amyloid peptides (Aß).  
Beginning as monomers, these proteins fibrilize into increasingly complex and toxic intermediates, 
ending with the aggregation of amyloid proteins.  As demonstrated by Cheng (2005), melatonin may function 
as an inhibitor of Aß aggregation based on tests involving the Aß (1-40) strand.  Because point mutations 
at the hair-pin turn (Aß 22-35) affect the solubility of intermediates as well as their rate of fibrilization, 
this area became our focus.  Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) will be used in combination with 
Congo Red to quantitatively measure the inhibition capabilities of melatonin on Aß proteins and its mutations.  
The measured effects of melatonin on the 22-35 fragment may help pave the way for future preventive 
treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
