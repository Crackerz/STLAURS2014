<a name="whoparticipate"></a><div class="question">Who can participate in the CAURS symposium? Who can attend?</div> 
<div class="answer">Any University of Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago, Loyola University Chicago, Illinois Institute of Technology, DePaul University, or Northwestern University undergraduate who has been conducting a faculty-mentored research project is eligible to submit an application and abstract to present at the Symposium. Other midwest institutions can apply with prior approval from CAURS commitee. A registration fee of $25.00 will be charged to participants from non-participant schools, these participants will be contacted by an Inter-School Board member with payment information. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend.</div>

<a name="whensubmit"></a><div class="question">When do I have to submit an application and abstract for the 2011 Symposium?</div> 
<div class="answer">The deadline for poster and oral presentations for CAURS 2011 has passed. Information for the 2012 symposium will be posted as soon as it is available.</div>

<a name="howreview"></a><div class="question">How are applications accepted and abstracts reviewed?</div> <div class="answer">After consultation with the members of the Inter-School Board, a representative from the board will notify students with the status of their application.</div>

<a name="oralorposter"></a><div class="question">How do I know if I am an oral presenter or a poster presenter?</div> 
<div class="answer">
On the application, you will indicate your preference for talk or poster; you can select both. Upon review of your application, and acceptance of your abstract, you will receive a confirmation e-mail from the symposium director, indicating the time and location of your oral presentation or simply confirming your poster presentation, depending on what you checked in your application. There will be sixteen oral presentations, up to 300 posters.</div>

<a name="two"></a><div class="question">I worked on two different projects. Can I make two presentations?</div> 
<div class="answer">Yes, but remember to submit an Application & Abstract Submission Form for each project you wish to present.</div>

<a name="group"></a><div class="question">Can a group of us make one presentation?</div> 
<div class="answer">Yes. Each group member must fill out a registration form, but only one group member must complete Sections 3 and 4. Please make sure all group members fill out the same "group name" on the registration form. Contact CAURS if you have any problems submitting your application.</div>

<a name="noapproval"></a><div class="question">Can I present if I do not have an IRB or IACUC approval (assuming your project includes human or animal subjects, respectively)?</div> 
<div class="answer">No. Your application will be rejected if we are not able to verify the protocol number you provided on your application.</div> 

<a name="nonmentor"></a><div class="question">Can I have a non-UC, UIC, Loyola, IIT, Depaul, or NU faculty mentor and still present at the Symposium?</div> 
<div class="answer">Yes. You are eligible to submit an application and abstract for the Symposium. Your mentor can be a faculty mentor at another institution, or a senior researcher at a national, private, or federal organization. You still need to provide evidence of IRB or IACUC approval for your study if applicable.</div> 

<a name="abstractreqs"></a><div class="question">What are the requirements for the abstract?</div> 
<div class="answer">It needs to be submitted with the application form and be text only (no graphs, charts, or tables). It should be no longer than 250 words, typed as one single-spaced paragraph, and contain a title. Make sure to review and edit the abstract with your faculty mentor before you submit it.</div>

<a name="familyfriends"></a><div class="question">Can I invite friends and family to come view my presentation?</div> 
<div class="answer">Yes! You can invite as many guests as you would like. However, only presenters and their faculty advisors are invited to the closing banquet for free. A limited number of seats may be open for the banquet, but guest registration will open later.</div> 

<a name="posterreqs"></a><div class="question">What are the requirements for posters?</div> 
<div class="answer">Whatever you and your advisor feel is appropriate for your research. The Symposium Guidelines provides some additional guidelines, but here is some general poster information. Poster presentations should be displayed on a 3' or 4' (height) by 4' (width) poster board. Space on a poster is limited, so pick wisely what to present. Your display should be self-explanatory and have a logical flow; others should be able to follow the order even if you are not present. Place your title at the top of the poster and make sure that the text is large (usually at least 2 inches in height) and clear. Include your name and major, and the name of your faculty mentor and his/her department name, in addition to other co-authors. Incorporate appropriate graphics in your poster. Label or describe any charts, tables, figures, graphs, or photos that you use. Posters may be printed on separate boards, however we prefer a single sheet. Many university departments can help you with printing posters. One local source for commercial poster printing is makesigns.com.</div> 

<a name="oralreqs"></a><div class="question">What are the requirements for the oral presentations?</div> 
<div class="answer">Consult the Symposium Guidelines for help in crafting an oral presentation. Oral presentation should be no longer than 10 minutes. Also please plan on a 3 minute Q&A period. There will be 2 minutes allowed for each changeover.</div> 

<a name="avmaterials"></a><div class="question">What if I need audio-visuals during the Symposium?</div> 
<div class="answer">On the application, let CAURS know what you need for your presentation, whether it's a slide projector and screen, computer & LCD projector, or software. You will be notified by e-mail (at the address you provided on your application) prior to the symposium if we are not able to accommodate your equipment requests as indicated on your application. At this time we will ask you to bring your presentation on a different medium.</div> 

<a name="different"></a><div class="question">My presentation at the Symposium will be different from what was proposed. Is this acceptable?</div> 
<div class="answer">Yes, but any dramatic changes (such as different project or different mentor) need to be approved by your faculty mentor.</div> 

<a name="goover"></a><div class="question">Can I go over my presentation with a member of the CAURS Team?</div> 
<div class="answer">Yes, simply contact CAURS.</div> 

<a name="arrival"></a><div class="question">When does a presenter need to come to the Symposium?</div> 
<div class="answer">We ask that all presenters arrive during the registration period starting at 11:30 am. Oral presenters should familiarize themselves with the room and any equipment (please make clear on your abstract submission form) that they will use in their presentation.</div>
