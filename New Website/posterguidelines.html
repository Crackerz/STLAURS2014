            <h1>Poster Presentation Guidelines</h1>
			<div id="guidelines">
<p>Posters will be on display for the duration of the symposium. Authors are expected to be present with their poster during the time slot allocated for the poster session in the conference program.</p>
<h4>POSTER SIZE</h4>
<p>Poster boards should be no bigger than 3'-4' (height) by 4' (width). Your faculty adviser will usually know the best way to print your poster board on campus, but poster boards can also be purchased at a printing or stationary store. Pushpins and tape will be available at the conference to assemble your poster board, but we strongly recommend that you bring your own assembly materials. Easels will be provided at the event. If you need a table for additional materials, please request it from us as soon as possible.</p>
<h4>POSTER BOARD FORMATTING AND LAYOUT</h4>
<p>The presentation title should be printed across the top of the poster at least two inches high. Beneath the title, the name of the student presenter, faculty advisor, and home institution should be at least 36 pt or about one inch high. Subheadings should be at least 24 pt and all text, including figures and tables, should be no smaller than 16-18 pt. Everything should be large enough to read from several feet away. Arrange materials in columns rather than rows. Text should not be less than 16 pt in size. Use a font that is easy to read from a distance such as Arial or Times Roman. As a general rule, place an introduction at the upper left of the poster and conclusions at the lower right, both in large letters. Use ample white space as an organizational tool. Stick with a simple color scheme and up to two fonts. Include appropriate graphics and text, and make sure everything is spelled correctly. Inappropriate or incomplete poster boards will not be displayed.</p>
<h4>ILLUSTRATIONS</h4>
<p>The poster will be viewed from a distance, so pictures can effectively communicate what might take many words to explain. Carefully considered use of charts, tables, figures, graphs, or photos can capture important aspects of your research and reduce the amount of text. Use figures to illustrate your experimental design, theories, procedure, stimuli, and results. Each illustration should have a heading in large type that clearly states the significance of the figure. A caption of detailed information should be provided below. It should clearly describe the content of the illustration and the conclusions to be drawn from it.</p>
<h4>HANDOUTS</h4>
<p>Optional: Consider preparing a short handout about your poster so that conference participants who view it will have information for reference. Include your contact information (especially your e-mail address) on handouts</p><p>You can also bring your poster presentation on individual sheets of paper and construct your poster the morning of the event, directly on the poster board that CAURS provides.</p>
<h4>PRACTICAL MATTERS</h4>
<p>Use your poster space wisely. Your display should
be self-explanatory and have a logical flow. Others
should be able to follow the order even if you are not
present.</p><p>It takes time to make a great poster. Allow a couple days to assemble all pieces, and never save anything for the last minute.</p><p>Consider the portability of your poster. A great poster is easy to assemble on site and can be flexible in case the poster space is smaller than planned. Arrange for help in case mounting the poster is difficult. A map of how the poster should look when it is done is handy in case you need to work quickly, are distracted or nervous.</p><p>Posters can be made in many styles. Roll-up single piece prints, individual boards, hinged boards that fold together all have their pluses. The style you choose is a matter of cost and personal taste.</p>
<h4>PRESENTING</h4>
<p>During your presentation, stand to the side of your display so that you do not block it. Your presentation should be a short summary speech about 3-5 minutes long. You should also be prepared to answer questions about your research. Because this is an excellent networking opportunity, it is important to speak and interact professionally. You will receive feedback for your work as well.</p><p>In addition to your presentation, it may be wise to also prepare a short 1 minute summary of your research for any guests browsing over your poster.</p><p>Practice often and be familiar with your poster.</p>
<h4>ADDITIONAL TIPS FOR DESIGN</h4>
<p>There are many web sites that contain useful tips for designing informative and eye-catching conference posters. Some of the sites even include templates that can be modified for your own use. To learn more, point your web browser to the following URLs:<br /><br />
