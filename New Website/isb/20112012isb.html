<h1>The Inter-School Board</h1>
<div id="intro">
<a name="home"></a><p>One of the most unique facets of CAURS and one that we pride ourselves on greatly is that the event is planned and run almost entirely by undergraduates. The CAURS Inter-School Board (ISB) is comprised of dedicated students from the 6 CAURS member institutions who work year-round to organize and arrange every aspect of the symposium. We encourage you to get to know the CAURS ISB representatives from your school and to contact us anytime with any questions or comments you have.</p>
