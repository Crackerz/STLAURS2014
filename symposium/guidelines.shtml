	<h2>Symposium Guidelines</h2>
	<h3>Abstracts</h3>
		An abstract is an outline/brief summary of your research project. It should be a well developed summary that is concise and comprehensive.
		<ul>
			<li>It should have an introduction, body, and conclusion</li>
			<li>It should explain the importance of the project, its purpose, the methodology/procedure, what was learned, and conclusions.</li>
			<li>It must be understandable to those outside of your field.</li>
			<li>Do not include any figures, graphs, or tables.</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>Posters</h3>
		If you are using a show wall to present your research, the maximum poster size is 42"x60". The recommended size for a posters on a show wall is 42"x48".

		If you are presenting on an easel, the maximum poster size is 42"x48". Easels offer no support for your poster, therefore your poster must be printed on a firm material that can keep itself upright.
		<br><br>
		Although supplies such as pushpins will be available for mounting posters, these will be limited. We strongly encourage you to bring your own mounting material. Our show walls are made of a fabric, therefore safety pins work well.	
		<br><br>
		During your presentation, stand to the side of your poster so you do not block it. Your presentation should be a short summary speech about 3-5 minutes long. You should be prepared to answer questions about your research. It is important that you dress and interact professionally.
	<h3>Oral Presentations</h3>
		Oral presentations should range from 25 to 30 minutes, and have accompanying visual aids. Each oral presentation will be provided a projector for displaying media, you are required to bring a laptop. It is a good idea to have a backup of your presentation on a flash drive in the event you encounter technical problems connecting to the projector.
