The Inter-School Board is composed of members from each of the participating universities with the purpose of organizing the symposium. Most of the planning and coordination of the symposium is done by the undergraduate students that comprise the board. 
<br /><br />
<div class="section">Leadership:</div>
The idea behind the new organization structure is that each level of leadership (from Director to Co-Director to Director of Advertising) has a large amount of creative input in their domain and is accountable for the work being done. This empowers the student to accomplish the goals of the organization in a way that also fits with their interests and desires.
<br /><br />
<div class="section">Members:</div>
Members represent the body of the organization. They help provide crucial general support which enables the event to be successful. Members help throughout the year and learn information that can be carried to future symposiums as members become the leadership of future symposiums. 
<br /><br />
<div class="section">Directors:</div>
There will be either one or two directors selected from the hosting university. The directors are responsible for coordinating efforts between schools, ensuring the organization is working towards its goals, and organizing the Inter-School Board meetings between the Co-Directors.
<br /><br />
<div class="section">Treasurer:</div>
There will be one treasurer responsible for managing the finances of the organization. (may want to actually leave this to an admin who oversees it from year to year. Helps create sustainability)
<br /><br />
<div class="section">Director of University Outreach:</div>
There will be a single student responsible for reaching out to Saint Louis area universities and establishing a board presence. They will be responsible for preparing that board to follow the guidelines of STLAURS and assist the university in becoming a sponsoring university.
