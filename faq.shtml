		My presentation at the Symposium will be different from what I applied with and proposed. Is this acceptable?
		<div class="answer">
			Yes, small changes are acceptable to a project. We understand the dynamic endeavor that is research. However, very large changes that alter the goal or dramatically change project results will need to be reviewed again. We ask that if this occurs to please notify us at least 2 weeks prior to the event for us to review the changes and integrate your abstract changes into our program prior to being printed. If you are unsure as if your change would be considered a “dramatic” change it is imperative that you contact us. Changing your project without notifying the board may make you ineligible for awards.

		How are applications and abstracts reviewed?
		<div class="answer">
			The Inter-School Board meets throughout the year to review abstract submissions. We strive to accept all applications, however we are limited by the size of our venue. After the Board reaches a decision on your abstract submission, a representative from the Board will notify you with the status of your application.

		Can I invite family and friends to come view my presentation?
		<div class="answer">
			Yes! Our event is open to the public and we encourage you to bring guests! However, due to limited seating and budget, we may not be able to accommodate all guests for our catered meal. If you want your guests to be able to attend the lunch, you must list them during registration. In the event your application is approved, we will contact you regarding the meal. If you have guests who are not registered for a meal, there are many dining options in our venue and within walking distance of campus.

	<div class="question">
		Can a group of student who worked on a project together still present?
		<div class="answer">
			Yes, this is acceptable. Only one application is needed for the group of students who worked on the project. Please make sure that all names are put down on the application so that everyone is represented and we can put everyone on our roster. Research is all about working together and networking, we encourage this kind of work!
